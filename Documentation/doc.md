Each class have one specific responsibility, and all dependencies are on interfaces, not specific implementations. 

The three remaning principles: open/closed principle, Liskov substitution principle and Interface segregation principle is not required for this solution.

This code also tries to adhere to the DRY principle and the KISS principle as an overall goal.
